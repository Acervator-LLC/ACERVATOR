# Proof of Accumulation

Reference. **Not built.** The window builds neither the Competition tab nor the
Local Testnet tab. The tab row carries an empty tab labelled Accumulation in
their place, and issue #147 carries the build-out. `src/competition/` is the
Proof of Accumulation package, and its engine runs today with no screen in
front of it. The rest of this file describes that engine and the contract
design behind it, as a design, not as a shipped feature.

The design is an on-chain competition layer where bots compete publicly and the
winners are awarded ACRV tokens on Base, which is Coinbase's L2. It evolved
from a bot identity and an append-only trade log into Elo ratings, tournament
brackets and an in-platform chain. Every Acervator bot has a cryptographic
identity. During a competition each trade is signed and appended to a Merkle
tree, and at the end the bot submits only the Merkle root — a 32-byte hash that
commits to the whole trade history without revealing one trade of it. The
strategy stays private, the proof is public, and the winner takes ACRV and an
NFT trophy.

## The skeleton

The tab exists and draws three lines: its name, one sentence saying it is not
built, and the issue that owns it. It reads no competition, no token balance
and no trophy.

`src/gui/main_tabs/proof_of_accumulation_tab_surface.py` — the whole empty state

```python
HEADING = "Accumulation"
ISSUE = 147
BUILT = False
STATE_TEXT = "This tab is not built."
ISSUE_TEXT = f"Issue #{ISSUE} carries the build-out."
```

Two frontends draw that one view model. `EmptyTabsMixin` in
`src/gui/main_tabs/empty_tabs.py` builds the Qt tab, and
`src/gui/web/proof_of_accumulation_tab.js` registers a panel with the Electron
shell's panel host. `src.core.desktop_bridge` serves the model under
`proof_of_accumulation_tab.state`.

## Identity

Each instance gets an Ed25519 keypair. The private key signs every trade in the
log. The public key is the identity another party verifies against. Strategy
parameters are never signed and never published, so authorship is provable
while the method stays private.

`src/competition/bot_identity.py` — `BotIdentity`

```python
class BotIdentity:
    """
    Manages a bot's Ed25519 keypair.  The private key never leaves this object
    unencrypted.  The public key is the bot's network-visible identity.
```

## The trade log

Each signed trade appends to a Merkle tree. Leaves are the SHA-256 of a trade's
canonical bytes, the root is the commitment, and a proof lets a third party
confirm one trade sits in the log without receiving the log.

`src/competition/merkle_log.py` — `verify_proof`

```python
def verify_proof(leaf_hash: str, proof: List[dict], root: str) -> bool:
    """Verify a Merkle inclusion proof."""
    current = leaf_hash
    for step in proof:
        if step["position"] == "left":
            current = _node_hash(step["hash"], current)
        else:
            current = _node_hash(current, step["hash"])
    return current == root
```

`merkle_root` returns the commitment and `merkle_proof` builds the inclusion
proof one trade at a time.

## The competition lifecycle

Four phases run in order.

`src/competition/competition_engine.py` — the module's own summary

```python
  1. REGISTRATION  — bots register with capital commitment + config hash
  2. ACTIVE        — bots trade; each trade appended to their Merkle log
  3. SUBMISSION    — trading closes; bots submit Merkle root + performance claim
  4. ADJUDICATION  — arbiter verifies submissions, ranks bots, awards tokens
```

A competition runs either locally across instances on one machine and one price
feed, or between two machines exchanging signed submissions.

## Tournaments

`TournamentEngine` in `src/trading/poa_tournament.py` builds the game shapes.
Each builder returns a tournament from a configuration, and one run method
plays it over a candle provider to an outcome.

| Builder | Shape |
| ------- | ----- |
| `build_duel` | Two participants, head to head |
| `build_melee` | A whole field at once |
| `build_gauntlet` | One challenger against a sequence |

`src/trading/poa_tournament.py` — `TournamentEngine.build_duel`

```python
def build_duel(
    self,
    a: Participant,
    b: Participant,
    season: Season,
    acrv_purse: int = 10,
    seed: Optional[int] = None,
```

`DynamicEventScheduler` places market shocks, puzzle events and regime flips
from the configuration's seed, so the same seed replays the same tournament.
`LocalACRVAdapter` settles the award and each tournament persists as JSON.

## The token

The ledger is append-only, and four methods are its whole surface.

`src/competition/token_ledger.py` — `TokenLedger`

```python
class TokenLedger:
    """
    Append-only ACRV token ledger.

    award()  — mint tokens for a competition result (idempotent)
    balance()  — current balance for a bot
    total_minted()  — total ACRV in existence
    remaining_supply()  — tokens still mintable this season
    """
```

The hard cap is ten million, and the ledger refuses an award that would pass
it. Each season awards less than the one before, so later tokens are harder to
earn.

`src/competition/season_schedule.py` — the supply constants

```python
TOTAL_SUPPLY_CAP = 10_000_000  # Hard cap — immutable
GENESIS_SEASON = 1
INITIAL_REWARD = 500_000  # Season 1 reward pool
DECAY_FACTOR = 0.85  # Each season awards 85% of the prior season
MIN_SEASON_REWARD = 100  # Floor — never less than this per season
```

Awards are idempotent: settling the same result twice writes one record.
Balances are replayed from the log, and no operation edits a balance.

Five tiers are awarded on rank within the field, and the rarest three carry a
lifetime cap on how many can ever exist. Each tier is named for a stage of the
Corpus Hermeticum alchemical path, and pays a fixed number of tokens.

| Tier | Stage | Rank | ACRV paid | Ever minted, at most |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | --------: | -------------------: |
| Harvest | NIGREDO | top 50% | 10 | no cap |
| Gold Fold | ALBEDO | top 10% | 50 | no cap |
| Bear Slayer | CITRINITAS | top 25% in a verified bear market | 100 | 10,000 |
| Grand Accumulator | RUBEDO | top 1% across three consecutive seasons | 500 | 1,000 |
| Ekthelius | UNIO MYSTICA | perfect score across every metric | 10,000 | 21 |

## The token contract

The ledger above is the platform's own record. On the chain the token is an
ERC-20 called Acervator Token. Three of its properties are fixed when the
contract is deployed and cannot be changed afterwards: the supply cap, the one
address allowed to mint, and the absence of any way to burn.

`contracts/ACRV.sol` — the header, and the guard on minting

```solidity
//   • MAX_SUPPLY  = 10,000,000 ACRV (10_000_000 * 10^18 wei)
//   • Tokens can never be burned — supply monotonically increases
//   • The registry address is set once at construction and cannot change

    modifier onlyRegistry() {
        require(msg.sender == registry, "ACRV: caller is not the registry");
```

| Property | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| Standard | ERC-20, named Acervator Token |
| Chain | Base, chain id 8453 |
| Hard cap | 10,000,000 ACRV, held on the chain |
| Minting | the CompetitionRegistry contract only |
| Burning | never |

The contracts are not deployed. Two npm packages supply the libraries they
build on, and the deploy script takes the network and the signing key. Its own
instructions name the Base test network first.

`contracts/deploy.py` — how it is called

```bash
npm install @openzeppelin/contracts @chainlink/contracts
export ACERVATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
python deploy.py --network sepolia
```

`src/competition/season_schedule.py` — the last tier

```python
RarityTier(
    name="Ekthelius",
    emoji="∞",
    description="Perfect score across all metrics, any season",
    rank_pct_max=0.001,
    condition="100% win rate + top Sharpe + max capital efficiency",
    max_ever=21,
    base_value=10_000,
),
```

## Head to head

`challenge_protocol.py` carries the Elo ladder. A challenger sends a signed
challenge, the target accepts or declines, both trade the agreed asset for the
agreed duration, and the shared engine adjudicates.

`src/competition/challenge_protocol.py` — the ladder constants

```python
ELO_K_FACTOR = 32
MIN_ELO = 100
```

The stake flows from loser to winner and both ratings move.

## Trophies

One SVG per tier, picked by name. An unknown tier raises rather than returning
an empty drawing, and `generate_preview_html` lays the whole set out on one
page.

`src/competition/trophy_generator.py` — `generate_trophy`

```python
def generate_trophy(tier: str, data: TrophyData) -> str:
    fn = GENERATORS.get(tier)
    if not fn:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown tier: {tier!r}")
    return fn(data)
```

Inside `harvest_svg`, a text path letters the epigraph's own instruction around
the trophy ring, in its usual form: SOLVE ET COAGULA. Each drawing also letters
its own alchemical stage across the face.

`src/competition/trophy_generator.py` — the stage each tier is lettered with

```python
        "Harvest": "NIGREDO",
        "Gold Fold": "ALBEDO",
        "Bear Slayer": "CITRINITAS",
        "Grand Accumulator": "RUBEDO",
```

### Where a trophy's artwork is kept

The artwork and the metadata are held on the chain itself. The token's own
metadata call returns the JSON inline, and the picture inside that JSON is the
tier's drawing, also inline. Nothing points at IPFS, the file-sharing network
most NFT projects park their pictures on, and nothing points at any other host,
so a trophy lasts as long as the chain does.

`contracts/AcervatorTrophy.sol` — the metadata call

```solidity
            '","image":"data:image/svg+xml;base64,', svgB64,

            "data:application/json;base64,",
```

## The chain

`local_testnet.py` simulates the whole Base environment in memory, with no
wallet, no ETH and no network. Four classes make it up.

| Class | Holds |
| ----- | ----- |
| `LocalChain` | The blocks |
| `LocalACRV` | The ERC-20 balances and the mint history |
| `LocalRegistry` | Competitions, submissions and adjudications |
| `LocalTestnet` | The three above, plus a mock oracle and transaction receipts |

One call runs a whole competition on that chain and returns the result table.
It registers the entrants, trades them, takes their submissions, adjudicates,
awards the tokens and mints the trophy, with nothing written outside a
temporary directory.

`src/competition/local_testnet.py` — a demo run

```python
from src.competition.local_testnet import LocalTestnet

testnet = LocalTestnet()
result = testnet.run_demo_competition(n_bots=3, season=1)
print(result["results_table"])
```

The real targets sit ready for the day it deploys.

`src/competition/base_config.py` — the two chains

```python
  Base Mainnet: chain_id=8453  — production
  Base Sepolia: chain_id=84532 — testnet (deploy here first)
```

The contract addresses and ABIs sit beside them.

## The two shelved tabs

Both tab modules exist and the window builds neither. Their surfaces stay
registered in the bridge, so the view models answer with no Qt tab in front of
them. The Testnet tab is where a competition would be run and its blocks read
in a block explorer; today the demo run above is the only way to reach either.

`src/gui/main_tabs/retired_tabs.py` — `RetiredTabsMixin._install_retired_tab_sentinels`

```python
self._competition_tab = None

self._testnet_tab = None
```

Issue #147 carries the initial build-out.
